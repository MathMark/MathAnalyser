MathAnalyser represents a program which is able to analyse math functions. 

##Features
- Drawing graphs of math functions
- Analysing graphs of math functions in each seperate point (TO DO)
- Finding local and global extremums (TO DO)
- Finding derivative in each point (TO DO)
- Finding points where several functions across with each other

## Chart of functions

| Mathematical symbol or name of function | Keyword (or symbol) | Description |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| \|x\| | abs(x) | The absolute value of x | &radic;x | sqrt(x) | The square root of x |
| sign x | sign(x) | **The function "signum" of x.** Returns 1 if x greatest or equal 1 Returns 0 if x equal 0 Returns -1 if x less or equal -1 |
| log<sub>a</sub> x | log(a;x) | Returns the logarithm of x, which has base number a |
| ln x | ln(x) | Returns the natural logarithm, which has base number e |
| lg x | lg(x) | Returns the logarithm, which has base number 10 |
| x<sup>y</sup> | x^y | Returns the x powered by y |
| <sup>n</sup>&radic;x | x^(1/n) | The n<sup>th</sup> root of x |
